## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Configuration
Create `.env.production` file with:

```bash
# HDFC Production Credentials (REQUIRED)
REACT_APP_HDFC_MERCHANT_ID=<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
REACT_APP_HDFC_MERCHANT_KEY=<YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY>
REACT_APP_HDFC_VPA=<YOUR_VPA>@okhdfcbank
REACT_APP_HDFC_MERCHANT_NAME=<YOUR_BUSINESS_NAME>

# API Configuration
REACT_APP_HDFC_API_URL=https://upitestv2.hdfcbank.com/upi
REACT_APP_HDFC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET>

# QR Configuration
REACT_APP_QR_MCC=5499
REACT_APP_QR_MEDIUM=06

# Feature Flags
REACT_APP_ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=true
REACT_APP_USE_ACTUAL_API=true
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
```bash
# Run the database schema
mysql -u root -p < database/qr_complete_schema.sql

# Verify tables created
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'qr_%';" your_database
```

### Step 3: Backend API Deployment
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Set up PM2 for production
pm2 start server.js --name "qr-api"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Step 4: Frontend Build
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test the build
serve -s build
```

### Step 5: HDFC Integration Verification
1. **Test Environment First**
   - Use HDFC test credentials
   - Generate test QR codes
   - Process test transactions
   - Verify webhook callbacks

2. **Production Activation**
   - Submit production request to HDFC
   - Get production credentials
   - Update environment variables
   - Enable production mode
