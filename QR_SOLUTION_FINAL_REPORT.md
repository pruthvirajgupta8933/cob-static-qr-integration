- Sanitization for all user inputs

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach:
```
Phase 1: Deploy with feature flag (disabled) ← CURRENT STATE
Phase 2: Enable for test users only
Phase 3: Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
Phase 4: Remove feature flag after 2 weeks stability
```

### Quick Controls:
```javascript
// To disable temporarily (in SideNavbar.js):
const isQRFeatureEnabled = false; // Instant off

// To enable for specific users:
const testUsers = ["795", "31407"];
const isQRFeatureEnabled = testUsers.includes(userId);
```

### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# If issues arise (unlikely), rollback is simple:
git revert [commit-hash]  # Reverts QR changes
# OR just set feature flag to false
```
