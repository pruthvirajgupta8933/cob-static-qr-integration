# ✅ QR Payment Refund Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

The refund functionality for QR payments has been successfully implemented with the following components:

## 📝 Files Modified/Created

### 1. Redux Slice (`/src/slices/sabqr/sabqrSlice.js`)
**Added:**
- `processQRRefund` async thunk for processing refunds
- `fetchRefundStatus` async thunk for checking refund status
- Refund state in initial state:
  ```javascript
  refunds: [],
  activeRefund: null,
  refundHistory: [],
  loading: { refund: false, refundStatus: false },
  error: { refund: null, refundStatus: null }
  ```
- Extra reducers for handling refund actions
- Updates payment status to 'refunded' when refund is processed

### 2. RefundModal Component (`/src/components/dashboard/AllPages/static-qr/components/RefundModal.js`)
**Created new component with:**
- Transaction details display
- Partial refund toggle option
- Refund amount input (with validation)
- Refund reason textarea (required, min 10 chars)
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Important notices about refund processing time
- Uses CustomModal component (not react-bootstrap)

### 3. QRPayments Component (`/src/components/dashboard/AllPages/static-qr/QRPayments.js`)
**Modified to include:**
- Import RefundModal and useDispatch
- State for refund modal and selected transaction
- Refund button in actions column (only for successful transactions)
- "Refunded" status display for already refunded transactions
- Refunded transactions counter in stats
- Updated stats card to show refunded count

## 🔄 Refund Workflow

   - Modal opens with transaction details

2. **User fills refund form:**
   - Can toggle partial refund option
   - Enters refund amount (validated against original amount)
   - Provides refund reason (required, min 10 characters)

3. **System processes refund:**
   - Dispatches `processQRRefund` action
   - Calls HDFC API via sabQRService
   - Updates Redux state on success
   - Shows success toast notification

4. **UI updates:**
   - Transaction status changes to "refunded"
   - Refund button replaced with "Refunded" text
   - Stats update to reflect refunded transaction
   - Modal closes automatically

## 🎨 UI Features

### Transaction Table
- **Success status:** Shows yellow "Refund" button with undo icon

- **Body sections:**
